        <p class="text-dark">
            All Minnesota exists to support indigenous-led community meal distribution across the state.
            We believe everyone deserves access to nourishing food and that community meals build connection and dignity.
            This work is rooted in partnership with Native chefs, tribal nations, and local volunteers who make it possible.

        <h2 class="h4 text-primary-green mb-3">The Partnership</h2>
        <p class="text-dark">
            We work alongside Sean Sherman (The Sioux Chef) and the Indigenous Food Lab, along with tribal nations and community partners across Minnesota.
            Together we fund and coordinate meal preparation and distribution so that more people can share in culturally rooted, nutritious meals.
