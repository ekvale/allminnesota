        <p class="text-dark">
            All Minnesota exists to bring the whole state together in support of communities hit hardest by federal actions.
            We believe everyone deserves access to nourishing food and that community meals build connection and dignity.
            This work is rooted in partnership with indigenous-led initiatives, community organizations, and local volunteers who make it possible.

            Together we get nourishing, culturally rooted meals to the people and places that need them most.
